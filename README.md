# Memory-Management-API-Phase-1

CS 307 Operating Systems Homework3

In this project, I implemented a memory heap management API, and professor had provided a code for us to test our API. We were expected to create a shared memory, in order to manage memory requests coming from multiple threads and grant or decline requests based on free space available. We were also expected to manage all mutexes and semaphores for shared memory access.
